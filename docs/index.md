# Xdas documentation

*Xdas* is an open source Python library for managing, processing and visualizing **Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)** data. It transforms any DAS format into a self-contained data that encapsulates both the data and coordinate metadata.

**Main features**:

- Composability of operations: build your own data processing pipeline with a mix of xdas, NumPy/SciPy, and custom routines.
- Numerous multi-threaded signal processing routines and tools to manage complex datasets, including I/O latency hiding.
- Convenient data selection across multiple files, with automatic interpolation of small data gaps
- Parsers for common file formats (NetCDF4,HDF5) and DAS manufacturers (ASN, Febus, OptaSense, Sintela).
- Extendability to other dense and heavy N-dimenional arrays such as large-N seismic arrays.

It uses the
[xarray](https://xarray.dev) API to work with labelled multi-dimensional arrays.

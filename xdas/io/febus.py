def read(fname, overlaps=None, offset=None):
    """
    Open a Febus file into a xdas DataArray object.

    The Febus file format contains a 3D array which is a stack of 2D (time, distance)
    chunks of data that overlaps with each other. The overlaps must be trimmed and the
    chunks concatenated to form a seamless dataset. Each chunk is associated with a
    timestamp that is located at a fixed offset from the beginning of the chunk.

    Because of poor documentation of the evolution of the Febus file format, it is
    recommended to manually specify the overlap and offset parameters. If not provided,
    the function will attempt to determine the correct values at your own risk.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    fname : str
        The filename of the Febus file to read.
    overlaps : tuple of int, optional
        A tuple specifying the overlap in number of sample to trim on both side of each
        chunk of the data. If not provided, the function will attempt to determine the
        correct overlap at your own risk.
    offset : int, optional
        The location of the timestamp within each block given as the number of samples
        from the beginning. If not provided, the function will attempt to determine the
        correct offset at you own risk.

    Returns:
    --------
    DataArray
        A data array containing the data from the Febus file.
